Stellar Teye is a decentralized smart contract system for secure, encrypted, and role-based management of vision care and optometry records on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban and Rust. The project enables eye care providers and patients to maintain control over sensitive vision data while ensuring privacy, immutability, and auditability. Built specifically for optometry clinics, ophthalmology practices, and vision research institutions transitioning to blockchain-based record keeping.

The platform provides a comprehensive solution for modern vision care data management, combining the security benefits of blockchain technology with practical healthcare workflows. It's designed for optometrists, ophthalmologists, vision research institutions, and patients who need to maintain confidentiality while enabling secure data sharing between authorized parties.

|---------|-------------|
| 🔐 **Enhanced Security** | Military-grade encryption protects sensitive vision data |
| 👤 **Patient Control** | Patients grant and revoke access to their records |
| 🔄 **Interoperability** | Standardized format enables seamless data exchange |
| 📜 **Audit Trail** | Complete, immutable history of all record access and modifications |
| 👁️ **Vision-Specific** | Tailored for optometry and ophthalmology workflows |

### Target Users

- Optometry clinics and ophthalmology practices
- Vision research institutions
- Eye care insurance providers
- Patients seeking control over their vision data
- Optical retail chains and laboratories

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust 1.78.0+** - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Soroban CLI v23.1.4+** - [Install Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
- **Git** - For version control
- **Make** - For using the provided Makefile (optional but recommended)

### ⚡ Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Stellar-Teye/Teye-Contracts.git
cd Teye-Contracts

# Run the automated setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Or use the Makefile for step-by-step setup
make setup
```

### 🔧 Environment Setup

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

The `setup.sh` script handles everything automatically:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Install Rust 1.78.0 and required targets
- Install Soroban CLI v23.1.4
- Set up project structure
- Configure Soroban networks (local, testnet, futurenet)
- Build the project and run tests
- Generate default identity

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# Install Rust targets and components
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup component add rustfmt clippy rust-src

# Install Soroban CLI
cargo install --locked soroban-cli

# Configure Soroban
soroban config identity generate default
soroban config network add local \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc \
    --network-passphrase "Standalone Network ; February 2017"

# Build the project
cargo build --all-targets

# Run tests to verify setup
cargo test --all
```

### 🧪 Running Tests

Ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Or use cargo directly
cargo test --all

# Run specific test types
make test-unit          # Unit tests only
make test-integration   # Integration tests only
```

### 🌐 Network Configuration

The project supports multiple Stellar networks:

```bash
# Start local development network
make start-local
# or
soroban network start local

# Deploy to local network
make deploy-local

# Stop local network
make stop-local
```

**Available Networks:**

| Network | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Local | `http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc` | Development |
| Testnet | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443` | Testing |
| Futurenet | `https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443` | Staging |

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Contract Interaction

```rust
// Register a new patient
let patient_id = client.register_patient(&env, &patient_address, &patient_data);

// Add a vision exam record
let record_id = client.add_exam_record(&env, &patient_id, &exam_data);

// Grant access to an optometrist
client.grant_access(&env, &patient_id, &optometrist_address, &AccessLevel::Read);

// Retrieve vision records
let records = client.get_patient_records(&env, &patient_id);
```

### Using the Makefile
